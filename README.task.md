# Hungaroton Artist List Component

Implement a list view with pagination and filters. The list should include the
portrait, name, and albumCount in each item. You can find the Postman
documentation among the attachments, which contains all the necessary
information about the endpoint required for the task.

# Requirements:

-Use a known design system like MUI or ANTD
Sea-Use URLrchParams to store the filter params
-The application should be responsive
-Display 50 items per page

# Nice to have:
